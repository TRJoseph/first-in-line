This repository is the host to my scalping bot for amazon. I recently became impatient with the current GPU shortage and decided to create a bot that will attempt to purchase one (If you cant beat em' join em'). The bot uses Selenium WebDriver to efficiently webscrape a user specified amazon product page. This bot also implements Twilio's messaging API for quick and efficient notification text messages to let the user know as soon as their bot has purchased the product.
